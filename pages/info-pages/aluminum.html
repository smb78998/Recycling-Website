    <p><b>Aluminum recyclable within the Orlando recycling system üëç üëç</b></p>
  
    <p>Aluminum, steel, and tin cans are recyclable through the City of Orlando‚Äôs recycling program.</p>
    <p>To prepare aluminum for recycling, make sure to completely empty and rinse the container before placing it in the bin.</p>

    <p><b>How is Aluminum Recycled?</b></p>
    <p>Once collected, aluminum cans are sorted and cleaned to remove any leftover materials. They are then crushed into blocks and sent to a facility where they are melted down. 
    This molten aluminum is poured into molds to create large slabs or ingots, which can later be rolled into thin sheets. 
    These sheets are then used to manufacture new aluminum products ‚Äî often more cans! 
    Aluminum can be recycled over and over without losing quality, and the entire process can take as little as six weeks.</p>
